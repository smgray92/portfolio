          </div>
            <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Sharon Gray</strong>. I graduated from the <em>University of Washington in 2015 with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Microbiology</em>. After graduating, I earned a position as a Micorbiologist and Lab Technician at Institue for Environmental Health in Lake Forest Park, WA. In this job, I specialize in Bacterial DNA fingerprinting (also known as PFGE), which visually compares different strains of Bacteria. Other than this job position, I have previously worked as a Barista in one of the cafes of the Univeristy, and a Lab Technician in a Protein Crystallography Laboratory in the University. Although I appreciate Biology and working with microorganisms, I would like to be in a field that is continually growing and is not always repetitive. The Bacterial DNA fingerpringting work that I do in my current job as well as other Lab Technician jobs use <em>various computer software to analyze data and derive results</em>. Fascinated by what the software is capable of doing, I've taken an interest in programming. By learning this field, I hope to apply Biology with Computer Science so that I can appreciate biological research and have possible insight into solving complex biological systems. </p>

            <p>These are some of the projects that I've created using HTML and CSS:
              <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/Pet-Dog">
                <dl class="dl-horizontal">Pet-Dog-"Rosita the Puppy"
                </a>
                <dd>The webpage "Rosita the Puppy" is one of the first webpages that I've created. It consists of a picture of my pet dog Rosita, a short biography of her, and some of her favorite hobbies and foods to eat. At the bottom, there is a link to more information about pugs. This page only includes <span class="blue">HTML</span>.</dd>
              </dl>
              <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/Desserts">
                <dl class="dl-horizontal">Desserts-"Cupcake Nation"
                </a>
                <dd>This is a webpage about a made-up new cupcake store "Cupcake Nation" in town. It includes information about the cupcake store and a list of cupcake flavors. The page also has images of cupcakes and the store environment as well as links to the full menu of cupcakes available at Cupcake Nation. This <span class="blue">HTML</span> webpage incorporates <span class="red">CSS</span> to add more color and depth.</dd>

              <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/Boring-">
                <dl class="dl-horizontal">Boring-"Boring Lecture"
                </a>
                <dd>The "Boring Lecture" is literally about a long and boring lecture with fake contents. This project practices the use of lorem ipsum text to be able to fill in paragraph space and focus on formatting and page-layout first. The webpage uses <span class="blue">HTML</span> and <span class="red">CSS</span> to add style around boring contents.</dd>
              </dl>
              <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/shelter">
                <dl class="dl-horizontal">Animal Shelter
                </a>
                <dd>This <span class="blue">HTML</span> webpage is about a made-up animal shelter with pictures of a variety of animals as well as descriptions for each one. The project explores addtional <span class="red">CSS</span> styling techniques, such as adding borders and changing the spacial arrangement of the webpage by creating columns.</dd>
              </dl>
              <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/wikipedia">
                <dl class="dl-horizontal">Recreate a webpage-"Wikipedia"
                </a>
                <dd>The "Wikipedia" webpage is an attempt at recreating the layout of a Wikipedia site. In the webpage, there is a title, navigation bar, a side bar, and several paragraphs below. In addition to incorporating <span class="blue">HTML</span> and <span class="red">CSS</span>, this webpage includes Bootstrap, which provides more style and dynamic to the page. Some of the Boootstrap elements used in the webpage are the grid system and the panel, which wraps contents in a box and organizes it in rows and columns.</dd>
