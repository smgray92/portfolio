    <h2>My Webpages</h2>
    <p>These are some of the projects that I've created using HTML and CSS:
    <ul>
      <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/Pet-Dog">
      <li>Pet-Dog-"Rosita the Puppy"</li>
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li>The webpage "Rosita the Puppy" is one of the first webpages that I've created. It consists of a picture of my pet dog Rosita, a short biography of her, and some of her favorite hobbies and foods to eat. At the bottom, there is a link to more information about pugs. This page only includes Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/Desserts">
      <li>Desserts-"Cupcake Nation"</li>
    </a>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a webpage about a made-up new cupcake store "Cupcake Nation" in town. It includes information about the cupcake store and a list of cupcake flavors. The page also has images of cupcakes and the store environment as well as links to the full menu of cupcakes available at Cupcake Nation. This HTML webpage incorporates CSS to add more color and depth.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/Boring-">
      <li>Boring-"Boring Lecture"</li>
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li>The "Boring Lecture" is literally about a long and boring lecture with fake contents. This project practices the use of lorem ipsum text to be able to fill in paragraph space and focus on formatting and page-layout first. The webpage uses HTML and CSS to add style around boring contents.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/shelter">
      <li>Animal Shelter</li>
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li>This HTML webpage is about a made-up animal shelter with pictures of a variety of animals as well as descriptions for each one. The project explores addtional CSS styling techniques, such as adding borders and changing the spacial arrangement of the webpage by creating columns.</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="https://github.com/smgray92/wikipedia">
      <li>Recreate a webpage-"Wikipedia"</li>
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li>The "Wikipedia" webpage is an attempt at recreating the layout of a Wikipedia site. In the webpage, there is a title, navigation bar, a side bar, and several paragraphs below. In addition to incorporating HTML and CSS, this webpage includes Bootstrap, which provides more style and dynamic to the page. Some of the Boootstrap elements used in the webpage are the grid system and the panel, which wraps contents in a box and organizes it in rows and columns.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Through time and practice, I hope to gain more experience and knowledge in programming and apply this to my future career.</p>
