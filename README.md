# _Web Programming Portfolio_
#### _First Project for Epicodus Programming Class_
### _By **Sharon Gray**_
## Description
_This webpage is my web programming portfolio for the Epicodus class individual project. The contents of the portfolio consists of an "About Me" section, where I describe my interests, skills, education, my work experience, and how I have come to take a programming class. In addition, there is a list of projects that I have done in the class to demonstrate the techniques and skills that I've learned, and each one includes a description as well as languages used in the assignment (HTML, CSS). Each project in the list is also a link that leads to the GitHub site for that specific project._
